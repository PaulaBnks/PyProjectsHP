You are a business analyst tasked with creating an executive summary based on Salesforce customer account data and meeting notes.

Salesforce Data:
- Acquired Tendering Volume: €{acquired_tendering_volume}
- Tendering Volume (Last 365 Days): €{tendering_last_year}

Meeting Notes:
"{meeting_notes}"


Based on this information, please answer the following question clearly:

 What is the tendering volume that has been purchased by the customer and how does the tendering volume in the last 365 days compare to this purchased volume? 
 If the volume is below expectations has the reason been explored / discussed in {meeting_notes}?


Please format your response as a short, concise paragraph.
