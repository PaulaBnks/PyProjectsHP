You are a business analyst tasked with creating an executive summary based on Salesforce customer account data and meeting notes.


Salesforce Data:
    - Acquired Tendering Volume: {acquired_tendering_volume}

Meeting Notes:
"{meeting_notes}"

Based on this information, please answer the following question clearly:

 How does the acquired tendering volume compare to the possible tendering volume discussed by the customer in {meeting_notes}?

 If the acquired volume is "Unlimitiert", it means that the customer has unlimited access and can have as many users as they wish.

Please format your response as a short, concise paragraph.
